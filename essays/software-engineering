Every year the world slips more and more into the virtual internet experience. There is hardly any job anymore that doesn’t require you to be on the internet at least a little bit. It’s something we take for granted. But something that we may not often think about is that every website we visit was once designed. And even more than that the fact that the computer booted up and displayed our desktop was due to software designers. This shows how powerful software designers are. We often push the world forward. That is why I am looking forward to delving into software engineering this semester at UH Manoa. I hope to gain skills that will drive my career forward and allow me to be practically helpful to those around me.

One of the things that I am really excited about in this class is the web-based functionalities that are taught. I consider myself to be behind the curve when it comes to git and github proficiency. This is a skill I would like to develop over the semester. And, when it comes to software engineering, github is a necessity. Additionally, building a personal portfolio is something that will be extremely important for my future careers. This will give me the opportunity to make positive impressions on potential employers.

Additionally, brushing up on common web design languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript will equip me to create websites of my own. The little that we have dabbled in creating a website so far has been fun (although a lot of work).This is a skill that I hope to develop greatly, while jumping into software engineering. One experience that I hope to be able to do in the fairly near future is to create a website that is actually helpful to someone. In fact I have an opportunity to do so. I have a family-friend who wants help over the summer in designing a website that provides a bunch of resources regarding AI. I am excited in developing my software and AI skills this semester to potentially be able to help with practical projects such as these.

Being practically helpful and professionally proficient are the main things I look forward to in ICS 314. Ultimately, I look forward to gaining skills that will help me design software. This is a basic answer, but it is what I want. Software has taken over the world. Those who know how to design it know how to make projects that can impact society. Software engineers can change the world.
