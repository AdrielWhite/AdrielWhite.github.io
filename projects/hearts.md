In my senior year of highschool I participated in Hawai'i Education of the ARTS, a choir which has performed concerts and theatre productions for decades. A semester of practice went in to make the Spring 2022 Concert at Hawaii Theatre a reality. We meticulously drilled musical parts and harmonies. The concert was a great team-work building experience. A large amount of synchronization was needed for the concert to come together in both technicalities and our voices.

Additionally, me and my brother were the major narrators in the production. This was a solid opportunity to boost my public speaking skills as I had to address a room of over 1000 audience members. Also, my brother and I were only given the narration script the day of the performance. This meant I had to be able to adapt and improvise lines of narration on the fly. This was a chance to build speaking skills that will be helpful in any professional setting.
