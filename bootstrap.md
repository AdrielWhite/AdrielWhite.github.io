I remember a time when a tree was cut down in my church’s parking lot and a man carved a large humpback whale out of its trunk. The project took a fair amount of time; each week the block of wood looked more and more like a whale.  After a few months the carving was a masterpiece, with intricate designs and a beautiful finish. This kind of project requires a variety of tools. While it’s theoretically possible to do a carving with only hand tools, it would be tedious and difficult. A chainsaw and other power tools are extremely helpful to get the job done. Web design projects parallel these issues. Designing a website with purely HTML and CSS can feel like carving with only hand tools. It is therefore helpful to have more web development tools that make the process less tedious. Frameworks such as Bootstrap 5 are essential assets that define stylistic classes and provide consistency to web projects.

When styling with CSS there sometimes seems to be a million different ways to do the same thing. Inconsistent application of these methods can lead to bugs, formatting issues or problems when viewing pages on different devices. A benefit frameworks can bring to this picture is their pull toward a specific implementation within the application. For example, if a webpage needs multiple columns of information, Bootstrap’s “row” and “col” classes are extremely useful. Using Bootstrap’s classes also provides a consistent and predictable styling pattern. Any future coder can look at source code and immediately know how certain styling is accomplished just by seeing Bootstrap’s classes. Bootstrap’s classes are also helpful when designing common web page structures. If you need to make a navbar, look no further than the “navbar” and “nav-item” classes. There is really no need to reinvent the wheel. On the other hand, it is worth noting that Bootstrap can be a little boring. The consistency Bootstrap provides can lead to the same basic design over and over again, resulting in a recognizable look that many developers will be able to notice (especially if the same icons are utilized). Ultimately, however, the repeated designs Bootstrap may tend itself to, result in a clean and professional look for web projects.

The styling, spacing, and professionalism, provided by Bootstrap, lead to the discussion of another concept: customizability. Because, by design, Bootstrap provides classes that contain “chunks” of functionality, they can potentially lead to a loss of precision. It is important to remember that Bootstrap is a framework, not a library. This means that its implementation tends itself toward a predetermined skeleton for web applications. If a web designer wants to create something completely different from the norm, Bootstrap, may not be as helpful to them as it would be to someone making a mom and pop store’s website. However this does not mean Bootstrap requires rigid implementation by any means. The predisposed framework is undercut by the fact that designers can always add their own styling as well as add to or override Bootstrap’s classes. Bootstrap provides a customization ability that can save a lot of time, but won’t replace the need for detailed styling for the needs of individual web projects.

In sum, Bootstrap 5 provides structure and helpful resources for designing web pages. Its predefined classes provide a level of consistency and customization, that while not new to CSS can be time-efficient and if used correctly, simplify code. Bootstrap may not be for everyone, but it is a tool freely available to any aspiring web developer. It, however, can not and should not be used to avoid CSS styling altogether. Bootstrap provides the “power tools” helpful for designers, but the CSS “hand tools” will still be needed to put the finishing touches on any project.
